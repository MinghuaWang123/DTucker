Dataset Links:
1. PAV04.mat: 
2. GF5-6:

The code in this toolbox implements the ["Cross-satellite hierarchical multimodal denoising for hyperspectral imagery"]. More specifically, it is detailed as follow:

How to use it?
Directly run demo_PaviaU.m (DTucker) and demo_DTucker2 (DTucker+) to reproduce the results on the PAV04.mat (PaviaU case 4), which exists in the aforementioned paper.
Note that the data can be included in the file.

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data) and tune the parameters (important).

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
